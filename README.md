# Cryptography Project Using Python

Welcome to our Cryptography Project !!

Here you will work with four Cryptography algorithms as follow:

1. Caesar Cipher

2. Multiplicative Cipher

3. Rot 13 Cipher

4. One Time Padding Cipher

You will be able to Encrypt or Decrypt using any of these four algorithms, you can also enter your message either in the (Message Entry Box) or (Browsing txt File).

After Encrypting or Decrypting, you can save your result in a (txt file) for later using.

## Features

1. Easy and User Friendly Project.

2. Provide 4 different algorithms for Encryption and Decryption.

3. Read the message (plaintext or ciphertext) from a (Message Entry Box) or (Browsing a txt File).

4. Save the Encryption and Decryption result in a (txt File) on your device for later using.


## How to Use

1) Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Mohamed-Khlawy/Cryptography-Project-Using-Python.git

2) Run the Main_Page.py File.

3) Choose an Algorithm from the 4 provided algorithms.

4) In the algorithm GUI, choose the entry type (Browsing txt File or Message Entry Box).

5) Choose your message for Encryption or Decryption.

6) Choose either to Encrypt or Decrypt the message.

7) Enter your Key for applying the algorithm (except in the Rot 13, because its keyis fixed on 13 key shift).

7) Press on the (Process) Button for applying the algorithm on your message.

8) If you want to save your result, Press on the (Save) Button and choose the directory to save the file in it and press (Enter) on keyboard.

## File Structure

1) Main_Page.py ==> Main script to run the application.

2) Caesar Cipher.py ==> Caesar Cipher algorithm and its GUI components.

3) Multiplicative Cipher.py ==> Multiplicative Cipher algorithm and its GUI components.

4) Rot 13.py ==> Rot 13 Cipher algorithm and its GUI components.

5) One Time Padding.py ==> One Time Padding algorithm and its GUI components.
